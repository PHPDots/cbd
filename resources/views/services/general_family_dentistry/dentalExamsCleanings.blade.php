		   <p>Sometimes it can be difficult to keep your teeth perfectly clean and healthy. Windy City Family Dental provides regular dental exams and cleanings to help you maintain a beautiful, healthy smile. We invite you to call us today to learn about our dental exams and make your appointment with our friendly dentist.</p>
		   <p>Dental cleanings and exams are two of the most basic yet important preventive treatments we provide at our office. Each time you visit our dental practice for a checkup, we will provide a professional teeth cleaning and dental exam to help your smile stay healthy. During your teeth cleaning and exam, our dental team will: </p>
		   <ul class="list_1">
			   <li>Clean your teeth by removing any plaque or tartar (also called dental calculus), which can lead to tooth decay and periodontal disease</li>
			   <li>Floss and polish your teeth for a healthy, bright smile</li>
			   <li>Examine your smile for signs of any damaging dental conditions or diseases</li>
		   </ul>
		   <p>We utilize dental X-rays to further evaluate your smile and make certain that you receive the dental care you need. Regular dental cleanings and exams are essential in maintaining good oral health, preventing cavities and gum disease, and making sure that any damaging conditions are treated as early as possible. </p>
		   <p>Our dentist recommends that you visit us every six months for a routine dental cleaning and exam. We may suggest more frequent visits if needed, and we also encourage you to contact us if you suffer from a dental emergency, pain, or injury. To schedule your next appointment, we invite you to contact us today. We look forward to caring for your smile! </p>
