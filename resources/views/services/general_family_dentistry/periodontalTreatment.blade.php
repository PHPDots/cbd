			<p>Your gums are a vital part of your oral health. If you notice that your gums are swollen, tender, or bleed easily, you may have gum disease. Windy City Family Dental and our team at Windy City Family Dental in Chiacgo, Illinois, want to provide treatment for your gums and ensure that you continue to have a healthy smile. If you have questions about treatment options for gum disease contact us today to make an appointment with our dentist.</p>
			<p>Gum disease, also called periodontal disease, is a degenerative condition primarily caused by bacteria found in plaque. The bacteria inflame and infect the gum tissues, and when left untreated, can eventually cause the gums to pull away from the teeth. Untreated periodontal disease can result in bone loss, tooth loss, and gum tissue recession.</p>
			<p>If your gums are swollen, red, or tender, or if your gums bleed easily, you may have periodontal disease. Other common symptoms of gum disease include loose teeth, painful chewing, persistent bad breath, and receding gums that make your teeth appear longer than normal. Following an exam at our office, our dentist and team will be able to determine whether you suffer from periodontal disease.</p>
			<p> The treatment for gum disease is based upon your specific dental needs. Depending on the severity of the condition, our dentist may recommend additional professional dental cleanings, improved at-home oral hygiene, antibiotic treatment, scaling and root planing (deep cleanings), or gum surgery. We strive to help you restore your oral health and halt the progress of the disease. For more information on periodontal treatment, we welcome you to call or visit our office soon. We look forward to caring for your smile!</p>
