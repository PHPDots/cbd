		   <p>Dental veneers are often used to enhance the beauty of a smile. Each veneer is carefully created to match the natural appearance of your teeth. Windy City Family Dental has years of experience helping our patients achieve the smiles they have always wanted.</p>
		   <div class="video_block"><iframe class="" src="https://myvisualtutor.com/media/10" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" width="100%" height="700" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
		   <p>Veneers are very thin shells, typically made of porcelain or resin, that are bonded to the front of your teeth to enhance the beauty of your smile. Our dentist may recommend dental veneers to correct several types of smile imperfections. Porcelain veneers are an excellent choice for enhancing your smile because the color and translucence of porcelain is a great match for the natural appearance of tooth enamel. Porcelain is stain resistant as well, so your smile will stay bright for years to come. Resin veneers can also be matched to your natural tooth color. With dental veneers, you can achieve a beautiful, natural-looking smile that you will love to show off.</p>
		   <p>Our dentist may recommend dental veneers if you would like to improve the appearance of your smile. Custom-made veneers can be used for just one tooth or for your entire smile. We may suggest veneers to:</p>
		   <ul class="list_1">
			   <li>Close large spaces and gaps between teeth</li>
			   <li>Whiten teeth that are severely stained or discolored</li>
			   <li>Improve the appearance of irregularly shaped teeth</li>
			   <li>Correct slightly crooked teeth</li>
			   <li>Restore teeth that are broken, chipped, worn, or fractured</li>
		   </ul>
		   <p>We invite you to call or visit our office today to learn more about custom dental veneers and how we can enhance your smile. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
