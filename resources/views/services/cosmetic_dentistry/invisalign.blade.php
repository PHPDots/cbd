		   <p>If you feel the need to improve your smile and donâ€™t want to deal with the hassle of traditional braces, Invisalign may be an option for you.</p>
		   <p> Invisalign&copy; is a great choice for our patients who are searching for a more discreet orthodontic treatment option. Rather than using metal brackets and wires like traditional braces, the Invisalign system uses a series of custom-made, computer-generated plastic aligners to straighten your smile. Each set of aligners is designed to make small changes to the alignment of the teeth. As you switch sets of aligners about every two weeks, your teeth will be gradually, gently guided to their proper positions. You will also visit our office on a regular basis during treatment to make certain that your smile is progressing as planned.</p>
		   <p>In general, Invisalign can be used to treat the same orthodontic issues that are normally treated with braces. Our orthodontist may recommend Invisalign to correct: </p>
		   <ul class="list_1">
			   <li>Crowded teeth</li>
			   <li>Crooked teeth</li>
			   <li>Gapped and spaced teeth</li>
			   <li>Certain problems with the bite, such as an overbite, open bite, underbite, or crossbite </li>
		   </ul>
			<p>During your initial visit, we will determine whether you are a good candidate for Invisalign. This treatment is often a good choice for adult patients and others who are interested in a virtually invisible orthodontic treatment. In addition to being discreet, Invisalign aligners are also very comfortable because they are custom made from smooth, thin plastic. The aligners are removable as well, which allows you to easily remove them as needed in order to eat, brush, and floss. We welcome you to call or visit us today to learn more about Invisalign.</p><br>
