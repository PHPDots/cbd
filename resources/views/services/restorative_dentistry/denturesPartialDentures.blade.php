		   <p> Dentures are removable oral appliances used to replace multiple missing teeth. If you are missing several teeth or all of your teeth, dentures might be just what you need to restore the function, beauty, and health of your smile. There are two kinds of dentures: complete dentures and partial dentures. </p>
		   <ul class="list_1">
			   <li>A complete denture is used to replace all of the teeth in a full dental arch. We may suggest a complete denture to replace all of the teeth in both arches or just one, depending on your individual needs. Our dentist may suggest using a denture adhesive for improved stability.</li>
			   <li>A partial denture is used if you are missing multiple teeth but have remaining natural teeth. A partial denture often includes a thin framework or clasps that attach to the natural teeth for a secure fit.</li>
		   </ul>
		   <p> Our dentist may recommend complete or partial dentures to restore your smile if you are missing multiple teeth; dentures can improve your ability to properly speak and eat, restore your natural facial volume, and enhance the overall beauty of your smile. Your dentures will be custom made to fit your smile comfortably, aesthetically, and securely. We invite you to call or visit us soon to learn more about how dentures can improve your smile!</p>
