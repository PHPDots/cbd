			<p>Dental implants are permanent, stable tooth replacements that can be used to replace one missing tooth, several missing teeth, or all of the teeth. The dental implant post, which is a screw made of titanium, is surgically placed in the jawbone at the site of the missing tooth. This replaces the missing tooth root and ensures that your dental restoration is stable. A period of healing is then often required to allow the bone to begin to bond with the biocompatible post. Following this healing period, our dentist will place the dental implant restoration, or replacement tooth, which fits on top of the implant post. Depending on which teeth are missing and your personal dental needs, your implant restoration might be a dental crown, dental bridge, complete denture, or partial denture. Each dental implant restoration is custom made to fit your smile comfortably and aesthetically. </p>
			<p> Replacing a missing tooth can restore your smile to optimal health, function, and appearance. A dental implant is a great option for restoring your smile because the implant is designed to look, function, and feel just like your natural teeth, and with proper care, it can last a lifetime. For more information about the benefits of implant dentistry, and to schedule your implant consultation, please call or visit us soon. </p>
