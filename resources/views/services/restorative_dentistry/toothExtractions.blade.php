			<p>Tooth extraction is the removal of a tooth. While we strive to avoid the need to remove a tooth whenever possible, certain conditions may make tooth extraction the most effective option for returning your smile to good health and function. Following the tooth extraction, we are happy to provide you with one of our excellent tooth replacement treatments, if needed, to restore your smile to optimal health, beauty, and function.</p>
			<p>Several conditions may necessitate tooth extraction. Among these are:</p>
			<ul class="list_1">
				<li>Severe infection that has destroyed a significant portion of the tooth and supporting bone structure</li>
				<li>Serious decay that has damaged a tooth beyond repair, making a successful restoration impossible</li>
				<li>Crowding caused by too many teeth to properly fit in the mouth</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Our dentist uses great care and skill when performing a tooth extraction to ensure that your dental experience is as comfortable and painless as possible. We will also provide you with detailed post-treatment care instructions so you can properly take care of your smile as it heals. For more information on tooth extraction and to schedule your personalized consultation at our friendly dental office, we invite you to call or visit us today. We are committed to improving your smile!</p>
